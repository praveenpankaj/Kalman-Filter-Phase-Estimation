# Amplitude, Phase and Frequency Estimation using Kalman Filter

This was a graduate level project developed while I was a student at Texas A&M University in 2004. The original code was written for Simulink 5.0. I tested it on October 19, 2022 on the online version of Simulink, and this was working very well. The current desktop release and versions for Matlab and Simulink are R2020b	and 10.2, respectively. I am assuming that the online releases are in sync with the desktop ones, and I don't see any reason why it should not work. 

Kalman Filters are a very ingenious work and I would like everyone to appreciate the beauty in it's workings. In order to recreate the joy of discovering Kalman Filters, I wanted to open source these codes for the community.

The Kalman filter Block was developed by me and the other accessory modules are supporting modules developed by respective authors. Since this files are more than 18 years old, I do not remember the authors of the invidual accessory modules, and these modules are shared for educational purposes alone.

This repository is not maintained but it works well. I will add some documentation with experiments and results.
