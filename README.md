# Amplitude, Phase and Frequency Estimation using Kalman Filters
This was developed as a graduate student project at Texas A&M University in 2004 and was developed with Simulink 5.0. I tested this on the online latest version of Simulink. Matlab R2020b	and Simulink 10.2 are the current desktop softare release name and version.

The Kalman filter Block was developed by me and the other accessory modules are supporting modules developed by respective authors. Since this files are more than 18 years old, I do not remember the authors of the invidual accessory modules, and these modules are shared for educational purposes alone.
The modules estimates the Amplitude, Phase and Frequecny Estimation from a given signal. 

This model was first created when I was in grad school at Texas A&amp;M University, College Station. This repository is not maintained but it works well. I will add some documentation with experiments and results.
